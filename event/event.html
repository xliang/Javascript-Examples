JavaScript Event Handling 

Event Bubbling 
- Start at most specific element, and then flow upward toward lest specific elemennt 


Event Capturing 
- The lest specific node receive the event first, 
the most specific node receive the event last. 

Event Handling 
- a function called in reponse an event is call event handler 
- Event Handler begin with "on" 

// DOM level 0 method 
var btn = document.getElementById("myBtn"); 
btn.onclick = function () {
	alert (this.id); // to use this to access any of the elements's property or mehthods
	form within the event handler
}

// Remove event 

bt.onclick = null 

// DOM Level 2 Event Handling 

var btn = document.getElementById("myBtn"); 
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
	alert(this.id); 
}, false);

The major advantage ot use DOM 1 Level 2 method is that multiple event handler can be added. 

removelistener 
- can remove the event by addEventListener, but need to have some arguments. 
- anonymous function cannot be treatied as same arugment

DOM Event Flow
The event flow specified by DOM Level 2 Events has three phases: 
1. The event capturing
2. at the target
3. the event bubbling 

First, a function is created that wraps
the attribute value. That function has a special local variable called event, which is the event object 

<!-- outputs “click” -->
<input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="alert(event.type)">

The this value inside of the function is equivalent to the event’s target element, for example:

<!-- outputs “Click Me” -->
<input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="alert(this.value)">

<!-- 
     function () {
		with (document) {
			with(this) {
				attributes here ... 
			}
		}
     }		   
-->

<!-- event handler can access its property easily --> 
<input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="alert(value)">

<!-- 
     function () {
		with (document) {
			with(this.form) {
				with (this) {
					attributes here ... 
				}
			}
		}
     }

     if the element is form's input element, The scope chain also contains a entry for all of
     the parent form elements.		   
-->
<form method="post">
	<input type="text" name="username" value="">
	<input type="button" name = "Echo Username" onclick="alert(usernam.value)">
</form>
