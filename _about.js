Data Type

1. number
	a. 64 bits 

2. String 
	a. single (') and double (") quotes can be used to make string as long as the quotes at the start and 
	   the end of the string match. 
	b. Whenver a blackslash (\) is found inside quoted text, it indicates that the character after it has a 
	   special meaning. 
	c. If two backslashes follow each other, they will collapse together, and only one will be left in the 
	   resulting string value. 
	   "A newline character is written like \"\\n\"." 
	   -->
	   A newlien character is written like "\n"
	
	d. For cases like this, where you do not want any automatic type conversions to happen, 
	   there are two extra operators: ‘===’ and ‘!==’. The first tests whether a value is precisely equal to the other, 
	   and the second tests whether it is not precisely equal. So "" === false is false as expected.

	parentheses ()
	brace {}


 3. Function
